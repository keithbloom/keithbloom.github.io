{"name":"Keith Bloom","tagline":"Senior Software Developer","body":"I am a lead developer with over 20 years experience of creating business class enterprise software. My main focus is C#, the .Net platform and JavaScript. When writing software I use Test Driven Development backed up by Continuous Integration. I am keenly interested in creating robust software which is fit for the purpose. To do this, I follow the SOLID guidelines for OO design and I release quickly and often. My love of computing started when I was 8 years old when I wrote an adventure game on my ZX81. I loved that I could program a computer and create a game. Creating software is still my passion. I love learning, and my current interest is in functional programming and writing programs in Haskell, F# and Scala.\r\n\r\n* [Email](mailto:keith.bloom@infobit.co.uk)\r\n* [Blog](http://keithbloom.blogspot.co.uk)\r\n* [@keith_bloom](https://twitter.com/keith_bloom)\r\n* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/keith-bloom/4/883/17)\r\n* [Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/uk/cv/employer/11647)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
